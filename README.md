# PSG Video Navigator

A desktop application to navigate AVI/MP4 videos frame-by-frame and simulate mouse clicks at configurable screen coordinates. Built with Python, Tkinter, OpenCV, and PyAutoGUI, it is designed for cross-platform use (Windows, Ubuntu, macOS) with a focus on Polysomnography (PSG) video analysis or similar use cases. This project showcases backend development skills, MVC, and SOLID principles for a maintainable codebase.

## Features
- **Video Navigation**: Load AVI/MP4 videos and navigate statically (no playback) with buttons to jump forward/backward by 30 minutes, or to the start/end of the video.
- **Mouse Click Simulation**: Trigger mouse clicks at user-defined (x, y) screen coordinates via buttons, with specific clicks tied to navigation actions.
- **Configurable**: Set custom (x, y) coordinates for each click action through a Settings menu.
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs natively on Windows, with easy extension to Ubuntu and macOS using PyInstaller for standalone executables.
- **Open-Source**: Built with MIT/Apache-licensed libraries, ensuring no licensing issues for deployment.
- **Menu Bar**: Includes File (Load Video, Exit), Settings (Configure Clicks), and Help (About) menus for improved usability.
- **Responsive Video Display**: Video frames adapt to window size, displayed in a bordered frame, with a minimum window size of 400x300 pixels.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+ (tested on 3.11.7)
- Libraries: `opencv-python`, `pillow`, `pyautogui`, `pyinstaller`
- OS: Developed on Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS; deployable on Windows, Ubuntu, macOS
- System dependencies (Ubuntu):
  ```bash
  sudo apt install python3-tk libx11-dev libxi-dev libxtst-dev scrot
  ```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EssesDev/psg-video-navigator.git
   cd psg-video-navigator
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python pillow pyautogui pyinstaller
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. **Load a Video**: Click "Charger Vidéo" to select an AVI/MP4 file.
3. **Configure Clicks**: Enter (x, y) coordinates for each action (e.g., Clic1, Forward) and click "Set".
4. **Navigate and Click**:
   - Use "Simuler Clic 1/2" to trigger clicks at configured coordinates.
   - Use navigation buttons ("Début", "-30 min", "+30 min", "Fin") to jump through the video and trigger associated clicks.
5. The video frame updates statically in the UI, and clicks are simulated on the screen.

**Note**: PyAutoGUI performs real mouse clicks on your screen. Ensure coordinates are safe to avoid unintended interactions.

## Deployment
To create a standalone executable:
1. Run:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name psg-video-navigator main.py
   ```
2. Find the executable in the `dist/` folder.
3. For Windows: Transfer and run the `.exe`. For Ubuntu/macOS: Rebuild on the target platform with PyInstaller.

## Project Structure
- `main.py`: Entry point to initialize and run the application.
- `models/`: Contains `VideoModel` (video handling) and `ClickConfig` (click coordinates).
- `controllers/`: Contains `AppController` for coordinating models and view.
- `views/`: Contains `AppView` for the Tkinter-based UI.
- Follows MVC and SOLID principles for maintainability and extensibility.
- Tests: All dependencies (`opencv-python`, `pillow`, `pyautogui`, `pyinstaller`) validated on Python 3.11.7.

## Troubleshooting
- Fixed an `AttributeError` in MVC initialization by passing the controller to the view at creation, ensuring robust dependency injection.
- Resolved Tkinter/PyAutoGUI compatibility by using Python 3.11.7 with `python3-tk` on Ubuntu 22.04.
- Fixed `AttributeError` in menu bar by using lambda for safe controller method access.
- Fixed navigation buttons disappearing after video load by switching to grid layout for better widget management.

## Future Improvements
- Save click configurations to a JSON file.
- Add support for video playback (optional).
- Enhance UI with resizable video display and timestamp indicators.

## Development Workflow
- Changes are developed in the `dev` branch and merged into `main` after testing.
